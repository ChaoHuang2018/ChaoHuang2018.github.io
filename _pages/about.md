I am an Associate Professor in the [School of Electronics and Computer Science](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/school-of-electronics-and-computer-science) at the University of Southampton, UK from Feb. 2024.
I am also an Adjunct Assistant Professor (Honorary Position) in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/) at Northwestern University, US. My research interests include the formal verification and design of machine learning algorithms (in particular reinforcement learning) with respect to important properties, e.g. safety, security, robustness, etc., under uncertain environments. I am also interested in providing reliable machine-learning solutions to various applications in robotics, transportation, etc. 

Prior to Southamton, I was a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/) at the University of Liverpool, UK. Before joining Liverpool, I worked with [Prof. Qi Zhu](http://zhulab.ece.northwestern.edu/) as a postdoc fellow, in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/) at Northwestern University. Prior to Northwestern, I received my B.S. and Ph.D. in [Mathematics and Applied Mathematics](https://math.nju.edu.cn/en/index.html) and [Computer Science](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/main.htm) from Nanjing University, China respectively. I also visited the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.aau.dk/) at Aalborg University and was pleased to work with [Prof. Kim G. Larsen](https://kgl.cs.aau.dk/).
